ON SERVER SIDE:
- Creating a listening socket requires at least 3 API calls:
  1. Obtain a socket handle via socket()
  2. Set the listening IP:Port via bind()
  3. Create the listening socket via listen()

Pseudo Code:

fd = socket()
bind(fd, address)
listen(fd)
while True:
      conn_fd = accept(fd)
      do_something_with(conn_fd)
      close(conn_fd)

ON CLIENT SIDE:
- Connection socket is created from client side with 2 API calls:
  1. Obtain a socket handle via socket()
  2. Create the socket connection via connect()

Pseudo Code:

fd = socket()
connect(fd, address)
do_something_with(fd)
close(fd)

- Note that socket() creates a typeless socket; the socket type (listening or connecting) is determined after the listen() or connect() call
